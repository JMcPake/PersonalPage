        <h2>University of Edinburgh (2021-22)</h2>
        <p>I was a member of ISG (information services group) as a salaried employee of the university. My work on our IT infrastructure alongside my coworkers aided in the resilience and uptime of essential services, which has been >99% over the past 3 years. If you've ever used the myEd platform, you've probably used something I made!</p>

        <h2>New College Lanarkshire (2020)</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with developing a PHP/MySQL web app to plot out graphs visualizing late arrivals for the colleges' FA program. I gained experience here in consulting with Lecturers as stakeholders of my application and working within a defined SE framework.</p>
